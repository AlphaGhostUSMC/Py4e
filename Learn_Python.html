  <h3>To function or not to function</h3>
  <list>
    <ul>
      <li>Organize your code into "paragraph" - capture a complete thought and "name it"</li>
      <li>Don't repeat yourself - make it work once and then reuse it</li>
      <li>if something gets too long or complex, break it up into logical chunks and put those chunks in functions</li>
      <li>Make a library of common stuff that you do over and over - perhaps share this with your friends</li>
    </ul>
  </list>
